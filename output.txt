## **1. Latar Belakang (Background)**

Understanding the leading causes of death is crucial for public health planning and policy-making. By analyzing mortality data, we can identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that inform resource allocation, preventive measures, and health interventions. This project aims to delve into a dataset containing various causes of death to extract meaningful insights that can help improve public health outcomes.

## **2. Tujuan (Objective)**

  - Determine which causes of death are most prevalent.
  - Identify any correlations between different causes of death.
  - Explore temporal trends if time data is available.
  - Cluster regions or demographics based on mortality profiles.
  - Predict future mortality rates for specific causes.

## **3. Data**
